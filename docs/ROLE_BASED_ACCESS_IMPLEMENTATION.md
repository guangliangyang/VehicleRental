# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented role-based access control for the Vehicle Rental System with Azure Entra ID integration, supporting user categorization and anonymous access.

## Implemented Features

### 1. **User Role Categories**
- **User**: Normal users who can rent and return vehicles
- **Technician**: Technical staff who can manage vehicle maintenance status

### 2. **Role-Based Vehicle Status Management**

#### **Technicians Can Set Status To:**
- Available
- Maintenance
- OutOfService
- Rented (though typically handled by business logic)

#### **Users Can Set Status To:**
- Available (when returning vehicle)
- Rented (when renting vehicle)

### 3. **Anonymous Access**
- **Anonymous users** can find nearby vehicles via `GET /vehicles/nearby`

## API Endpoint Security Matrix

| Endpoint | Anonymous | User | Technician | Description |
|----------|-----------|------|------------|-------------|
| `GET /vehicles/nearby` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Find nearby vehicles |
| `GET /vehicles/user` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Get user's rented vehicles |
| `POST /vehicles/{id}/rent` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Rent a vehicle |
| `POST /vehicles/{id}/return` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Return a vehicle |
| `PUT /vehicles/{id}/status` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Update vehicle status |

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Authorization Policies**
```csharp
// TechnicianOnly: Requires Technician role
services.AddPolicy(PolicyNames.TechnicianOnly, policy =>
    policy.RequireRole(Roles.Technician));

// AuthenticatedUser: Requires User OR Technician role
services.AddPolicy(PolicyNames.AuthenticatedUser, policy =>
    policy.RequireRole(Roles.User, Roles.Technician));
```

### 2. **Role-Based Status Transition Rules**
- **Users**: Can only transition Available ↔ Rented
- **Technicians**: Can transition to any status except Unknown

### 3. **New Services Added**
- `IRoleService` / `RoleService`: Role management and checking
- `IVehicleStatusValidator` / `VehicleStatusValidator`: Business rule validation

## Azure Entra ID Configuration Required

### Application Roles Setup
Configure these Application Roles in your Azure App Registration:

1. **User Role**
   - Value: `User`
   - Display Name: `Regular User`
   - Description: `Can rent and return vehicles`

2. **Technician Role**
   - Value: `Technician`
   - Display Name: `Technician`
   - Description: `Can manage vehicle maintenance status`

### JWT Token Claims
The system expects roles in JWT tokens via:
- `roles` claim (standard Azure Entra ID claim)
- `ClaimTypes.Role` claim

## File Changes Summary

### New Files Created:
- `FleetService.Api/Authorization/PolicyNames.cs` - Authorization policy constants
- `FleetService.Api/Authorization/Roles.cs` - Role name constants
- `FleetService.Api/Services/IRoleService.cs` - Role service interface
- `FleetService.Api/Services/RoleService.cs` - Role service implementation
- `FleetService.Api/Services/IVehicleStatusValidator.cs` - Status validator interface
- `FleetService.Api/Services/VehicleStatusValidator.cs` - Status validator implementation

### Modified Files:
- `VehiclesController.cs` - Added role-based authorization attributes and validation
- `ApiServiceExtensions.cs` - Added authorization policies and service registration

## Testing Results
- ✅ Solution builds successfully (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- ✅ All 42 unit tests pass
- ✅ Role-based authorization properly configured
- ✅ Anonymous access enabled for nearby vehicles

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

1. **Configure Azure Entra ID Application Roles** as documented above
2. **Assign users to roles** in Azure Portal
3. **Update frontend** to handle role-based UI visibility
4. **Test with real Azure Entra ID tokens** containing role claims
5. **Deploy to Azure Container Apps** with updated configuration

## Security Benefits
- ✅ **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only perform actions appropriate to their role
- ✅ **Defense in Depth**: Both attribute-level and business logic validation
- ✅ **Standards Compliance**: Uses ASP.NET Core authorization framework
- ✅ **Azure Integration**: Leverages native Entra ID role capabilities
